### Part 1
1. No. It takes a full step for the bug to change direction.
2. Where the antennae are facing.
3. It changes direction by spinning.
4. A flower.
5. If it is facing an edge, then it changes direction. If not then it moves forward.

7. No.
8. It becomes darker as time passes.
9. No. It just stays there.
10. No. Once something else is there, the old object goes away.
#### Exercise:
1. | Degrees | Compass Direction |
|---------|-------------------|
|    0    |       North       |
|    45   |     Northeast     |
|    90   |        East       |

|   225   |     Southwest     |
|   270   |        West       |
|   315   |     Northwest     |
|   360   |       North       |
2. You can move it anywhere inside the grid. It will give an error message.
3. I used the setColor method.
4. The bug got squashed (It's gone).

### Part 2
1. It defines the length of the side of a square outlined by the bug.
2. The number of moves the bug makes.
3. It needs to turn twice to go from one cardinal direction to another in order to make a square.
4. Because it is able to draw from the parent class Bug.
5. No, it depends on where it is created.
6. No. It is a set box.
7. After the bug switches cardinal direction.
#### Exercises:
1. It's an octagon instead of a box.
5. To add another BoxBug actor, I would first initialize the actor with BoxBug name = new Boxbug(), thencall the location of the bug with world.add(new Location(x, y), name);. I could also initialize the color with name.setColor(Color.COLOR);
